1) What is python ?
A) * python is a high-level, interpreted general purpose programming language
   * its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significiant indentation
   * python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected
   * it supports multiple programming paradigms including structured, object-oriented and functional programming

2) What is high level programming language?
A) * High level languages are programming languages which are used fo writing programs or software which could be understood by the humans and computer
   * high level languages are easier to understand for humans because it uses lot of symbols letters phrases to represent logic and instructions ina program
   * it contains high level of abstraction compared to low level languages 

3) What is Dynamically typed language?
A) * These are the languages that so not require any pre-defined data type for any variable as it is interpreted at runtime by the machine itself
   * In these languages, interpreters assign the data type to a variable at runtime depending on its value
   * We don't even need to specify the type of variable that a fuction is returning or accepting in these languages
   * Javascript, Python, Ruby, Perl, etc are examples of dynamically typed languages

4) What is variable?
A) * Variables are used to store information to be referenced and manipulated in a computer program
   * They also provide a way of labeling data with a descriptve name, so our programs can be understood more clearly by the reader and ourselves
   * It is helpful to think of variables as containers that hold information
   * Their sole purpose is to label and store data in memory
   * This data can then be used throughout your program

5) What is type conversion?
A) The direct conversion of object of one data type to another data type is known as type conversion
